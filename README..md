### I made a WEB App for recipe generator ######

-- In this app you will start entering ingredient that you need to get a recipe from it.
-- you Can enter from 1 to 4 ingredients so app will accept 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 ingredients.
-- then it will return a picture for the recipe that match with ingredients and URL link for that recipe and instruction how to do that recipe.
-- after you get your recipe tou can find a input box to enter your opinion in it once you write your opinion like (cool, yummy, not good... etc) these opinions will sent to your mock API and save there for further using.



##### I used two get:
1. one to retrive recipe ID from recipe API.
2. second to send ID for that recipe to get recipe instruction and url and image.

##### I used one post
-- to add opinion and other information related to the recipe that I retrieve it includining ingrenients that I select it.
